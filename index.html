      <h3>Jakub Rozenek</h3>
	  <p>
	  I've been programming in python for about 6 years. However, I learnt programming at home by myself because
	  of the problem the school had with me picking GCSE Computer Science. However, when going into A-Level the teachers
	  saw my passion and they knew about my problem with GCSE Computer Science; so they allowed me to do A-Level Computer
	  Science with no prior experience (Only in programming). At the end of the 2 years i was averaging a A/B in my exams.
	  Therefore I was very fortunate and grateful that the school gave me an opportunity to do A-Level Computer Science.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Solar System Viewer</h3>
	<p>
	My first programming project, which was completed during the 2 week Programming bootcamp
	at City University Of London (2020). This project was written in processing which is a simplier
	version of java. This processing project demonstrates my understanding of the use
	of classes and 3D graphics in processing. I created a solar system viewer in which your able to pick the desired
	planet from 1 - 9 (Same order as the solar system) which are stored in a class in another file. The class
	is being called in order to draw the 3D sphere and apply the texture onto it. Finally, your able
	to see a few facts about the planet.

    <h3>Project 1: Programming In Java</h3>
	<p>
	This is my programming in java project, which was completed during year 1 term 2 at
	City University of London (2021). This project was written in Java using City 2d engine library
	in order to create game with animations, movement and collisions. This game is about destroying
	asteroids and prevnting the asteroids from hitting your or going past you; you'll need to destroy
	the asteroids in order to progress to the next level. Your able to save and load from different files.
	There's also background music which you can mute and also there's a play and pause button which your able to
	pause the game and then by pressing play your able to resume.
